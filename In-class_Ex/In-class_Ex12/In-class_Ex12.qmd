## Calibrating Spatial Interaction Models

In this section, you will learn how to calibrate Spatial Interaction Models by using Poisson Regression method.

### **Importing the modelling data**

Firstly, let us import the modelling data by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
SIM_data <- read_rds("data/rds/SIM_data.rds")
```

### **Visualising the dependent variable**

Firstly, let us plot the distribution of the dependent variable (i.e. TRIPS) by using histogram method by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
ggplot(data = SIM_data,
       aes(x = TRIPS)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

Notice that the distribution is highly skewed and not resemble bell shape or also known as normal distribution.

1.  right skewed
2.  has to be whole number

-   Use Poisson distribution to model

Next, let us visualise the relation between the dependent variable and one of the key independent variable in Spatial Interaction Model, namely distance.

```{r}
ggplot(data = SIM_data,
       aes(x = dist,
           y = TRIPS)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)
```

Notice that their relationship hardly resemble linear relationship.

On the other hand, if we plot the scatter plot by using the log transformed version of both variables, we can see that their relationship is more resemble linear relationship.

```{r}
ggplot(data = SIM_data,
       aes(x = log(dist),
           y = log(TRIPS))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)
```

### **Checking for variables with zero values**

Since Poisson Regression is based of log and log 0 is undefined, it is important for us to ensure that no 0 values in the explanatory variables.

In the code chunk below, summary() of Base R is used to compute the summary statistics of all variables in *SIM_data* data frame.

```{r}
summary(SIM_data)
```

The print report above reveals that variables ORIGIN_AGE7_12, ORIGIN_AGE13_24, ORIGIN_AGE25_64,DESTIN_AGE7_12, DESTIN_AGE13_24, DESTIN_AGE25_64 consist of 0 values. But we cannot log(0), therefore we need to replace the values.

In view of this, code chunk below will be used to replace zero values to 0.99.

```{r}
SIM_data$DESTIN_AGE7_12 <- ifelse(
  SIM_data$DESTIN_AGE7_12 == 0,
  0.99, SIM_data$DESTIN_AGE7_12)
SIM_data$DESTIN_AGE13_24 <- ifelse(
  SIM_data$DESTIN_AGE13_24 == 0,
  0.99, SIM_data$DESTIN_AGE13_24)
SIM_data$DESTIN_AGE25_64 <- ifelse(
  SIM_data$DESTIN_AGE25_64 == 0,
  0.99, SIM_data$DESTIN_AGE25_64)
SIM_data$ORIGIN_AGE7_12 <- ifelse(
  SIM_data$ORIGIN_AGE7_12 == 0,
  0.99, SIM_data$ORIGIN_AGE7_12)
SIM_data$ORIGIN_AGE13_24 <- ifelse(
  SIM_data$ORIGIN_AGE13_24 == 0,
  0.99, SIM_data$ORIGIN_AGE13_24)
SIM_data$ORIGIN_AGE25_64 <- ifelse(
  SIM_data$ORIGIN_AGE25_64 == 0,
  0.99, SIM_data$ORIGIN_AGE25_64)
```

You can run the summary() again.

```{r}
summary(SIM_data)
```

Notice that all the 0 values have been replaced by 0.99.

### **Unconstrained Spatial Interaction Model**

In this section, you will learn how to calibrate an unconstrained spatial interaction model by using `glm()` of Base Stats. The explanatory variables are origin population by different age cohort, destination population by different age cohort (i.e. wj3_destmedinc) and distance between origin and destination in km (i.e. dist).

The general formula of Unconstrained Spatial Interaction Model

![](https://is415-gaa-tskam.netlify.app/in-class_ex/in-class_ex11/img/image1.jpg)

The code chunk used to calibrate to model is shown below:

```{r}
uncSIM <- glm(formula = TRIPS ~ 
                log(ORIGIN_AGE25_64) + 
                log(DESTIN_AGE25_64) +
                log(dist),
              family = poisson(link = "log"),
              data = SIM_data,
              na.action = na.exclude)
uncSIM
```

### **R-squared function**

In order to measure how much variation of the trips can be accounted by the model we will write a function to calculate R-Squared value as shown below.

```{r}
CalcRSquared <- function(observed,estimated){
  r <- cor(observed,estimated)
  R2 <- r^2
  R2
}
```

Next, we will compute the R-squared of the unconstrained SIM by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
CalcRSquared(uncSIM$data$TRIPS, uncSIM$fitted.values)
```

### **Origin (Production) constrained SIM**

In this section, we will fit an origin constrained SIM by using the code3 chunk below.

The general formula of Origin Constrained Spatial Interaction Model

![](https://is415-gaa-tskam.netlify.app/in-class_ex/in-class_ex11/img/image2.jpg)

```{r}
orcSIM <- glm(formula = TRIPS ~ 
                 ORIGIN_SZ +
                 log(DESTIN_AGE25_64) +
                 log(dist),
              family = poisson(link = "log"),
              data = SIM_data,
              na.action = na.exclude)
summary(orcSIM)
```

We can examine how the constraints hold for destinations this time.

```{r}
CalcRSquared(orcSIM$data$TRIPS, orcSIM$fitted.values)
```

### **Destination constrained**

In this section, we will fit a destination constrained SIM by using the code chunk below.

The general formula of Destination Constrained Spatial Interaction Model

![](https://is415-gaa-tskam.netlify.app/in-class_ex/in-class_ex11/img/image3.jpg)

```{r}
decSIM <- glm(formula = TRIPS ~ 
                DESTIN_SZ + 
                log(ORIGIN_AGE25_64) + 
                log(dist),
              family = poisson(link = "log"),
              data = SIM_data,
              na.action = na.exclude)
summary(decSIM)
```

We can examine how the constraints hold for destinations this time.

```{r}
CalcRSquared(decSIM$data$TRIPS, decSIM$fitted.values)
```

### **Doubly constrained**

In this section, we will fit a doubly constrained SIM by using the code chunk below.

The general formula of Doubly Constrained Spatial Interaction Model

![](https://is415-gaa-tskam.netlify.app/in-class_ex/in-class_ex11/img/image4.jpg)

```{r}
dbcSIM <- glm(formula = TRIPS ~ 
                ORIGIN_SZ + 
                DESTIN_SZ + 
                log(dist),
              family = poisson(link = "log"),
              data = SIM_data,
              na.action = na.exclude)
summary(dbcSIM)
```

We can examine how the constraints hold for destinations this time.

```{r}
CalcRSquared(dbcSIM$data$TRIPS, dbcSIM$fitted.values)
```

Notice that there is a relatively greater improvement in the R\^2 value.

### **Model comparison**

Another useful model performance measure for continuous dependent variable is [Root Mean Squared Error](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-does-rmse-really-mean-806b65f2e48e). In this sub-section, you will learn how to use [`compare_performance()`](https://easystats.github.io/performance/reference/compare_performance.html) of [**performance**](https://easystats.github.io/performance/) package

First of all, let us create a list called *model_list* by using the code chun below.

```{r}
model_list <- list(unconstrained=uncSIM,
                   originConstrained=orcSIM,
                   destinationConstrained=decSIM,
                   doublyConstrained=dbcSIM)
```

Next, we will compute the RMSE of all the models in *model_list* file by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
compare_performance(model_list,
                    metrics = "RMSE")
```

The print above reveals that doubly constrained SIM is the best model among all the four SIMs because it has the smallest RMSE value of 1487.111.

### **Visualising fitted**

In this section, you will learn how to visualise the observed values and the fitted values.

Firstly we will extract the fitted values from each model by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
df <- as.data.frame(uncSIM$fitted.values) %>%
  round(digits = 0)
```

Next, we will join the values to *SIM_data* data frame.

```{r}
SIM_data <- SIM_data %>%
  cbind(df) %>%
  rename(uncTRIPS = "uncSIM$fitted.values")
```

Repeat the same step by for Origin Constrained SIM (i.e. orcSIM)

```{r}
df <- as.data.frame(orcSIM$fitted.values) %>%
  round(digits = 0)

SIM_data <- SIM_data %>%
  cbind(df) %>%
  rename(orcTRIPS = "orcSIM$fitted.values")
```

Repeat the same step by for Destination Constrained SIM (i.e. decSIM)

```{r}
df <- as.data.frame(decSIM$fitted.values) %>%
  round(digits = 0)

SIM_data <- SIM_data %>%
  cbind(df) %>%
  rename(decTRIPS = "decSIM$fitted.values")
```

Repeat the same step by for Doubly Constrained SIM (i.e. dbcSIM)

```{r}
df <- as.data.frame(dbcSIM$fitted.values) %>%
  round(digits = 0)

SIM_data <- SIM_data %>%
  cbind(df) %>%
  rename(dbcTRIPS = "dbcSIM$fitted.values")
```

### Plots

```{r}
unc_p <- ggplot(data = SIM_data,
                aes(x = uncTRIPS,
                    y = TRIPS)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)

orc_p <- ggplot(data = SIM_data,
                aes(x = orcTRIPS,
                    y = TRIPS)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)

dec_p <- ggplot(data = SIM_data,
                aes(x = decTRIPS,
                    y = TRIPS)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)

dbc_p <- ggplot(data = SIM_data,
                aes(x = dbcTRIPS,
                    y = TRIPS)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)

ggarrange(unc_p, orc_p, dec_p, dbc_p,
          ncol = 2,
          nrow = 2)
```
